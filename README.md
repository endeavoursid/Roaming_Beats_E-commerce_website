1. Install and Configure Oracle 10g Database:

Download and install Oracle Database 10g on your machine.
Follow the installation instructions provided by Oracle.
Make sure to remember the database username, password, hostname, port, and SID (System Identifier).

2. Set Up JDBC Driver:

Download the Oracle JDBC driver (ojdbc.jar) from the Oracle website or Maven repository.
Add the JDBC driver to your project's classpath. You can place it in the lib directory of your 
project or use a build tool like Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies.

3. Configure Database Connection:

Update your project's database configuration file (e.g., application.properties or persistence.xml) 
with the connection details.
The connection URL typically follows the format: jdbc:oracle:thin:@<hostname>:<port>:<SID>
Provide the username, password, and other necessary properties for connecting to the Oracle database.

4. Deploy Your Web Application:

Deploy your WAR file to a servlet container or application server like Apache Tomcat, Jetty, or Oracle WebLogic.
Configure the servlet container or application server to use the Oracle JDBC driver and connect to the 
Oracle 10g database.
Start the servlet container or application server and deploy your application.

5. Run this Web Application:

Access your web application using a web browser or API testing tool.
Perform various operations to ensure that your application functions correctly and interacts with the Oracle 
10g database as expected.
